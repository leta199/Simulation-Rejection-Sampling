# Rejection Sampling

Also know as the "accept- reject" method is a way of generating samples of data from a complex probability function such as gamma functions. Just like we can generate points from a uniform distribution in R, using this method: we can generate points from any defined funtions whereby the points follow the probabilistic nature of said funtion. We can then use  use this as synthetic data that followd the compled distribution in: Monte Carlo simulations, fine tuning machine learning models and much more.  

*Statistics is fun!*

We will use R to generate data from the following gamma function and overlay the probability density function to show that the data follows the gamma function when x >= 5

This project will cover:

- How to define and graph a target probability density function.
- How to define proposal probability density function..

 
## HOW IT'S MADE 
Languages used: R (version 4.5.1)

## METHODS AND TECHNIQUES  
For this rejection sampling we will strat of by defining and graphing our traget pdf.

**Target probability denisty function**  

This is the gamma function we must sample from where x >= 5.  

`target_pdf(x)`  
Is the name of this function graphed as:

**Proposal probability denisty function**  

This is a known probability distribution that we can easily sample from e.g in R. It must follow the following criteria:  
1) Cover the target pdf i.e proposal_pdf(x) >= target_pdf(x) for any x
2) Be in the the general shape of the target

For this target proposal I seleced an exponential distribution with lambda = 1 translated by +5

`porposal_pdf(x)`
