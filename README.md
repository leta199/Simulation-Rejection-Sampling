# Monte-Carlo-Integration
Monte Carlo integration allows us to use simulation to make stochastic approximations of functions that do not have closed form solutions when integrated. I was mind blown to learn that this was a thing!! 

We will use R to simulate how we can solve this problem: 

This project will cover:

- Comparing Monte Carlo to Inverse transform methods.
- Approximate the expected value of Area of a circle.
- Plotting histogram of Inverse method vs Line graph of theoretical probability density function.
 
## HOW IT'S MADE 
Languages used: R (version 4.5.1)    
Environment: RStudio

## METHODS AND TECHNIQUES  
**Monte Carlo Method**
`sim_circle()` - We begin by defining a funcion that we will call to approximate the area of our circle with this method.     
- Define our set seed to allow for reproducibility.
- Set up 10,000 runs of the simulation.
- Randomly generate value of "r" from a uniform distribution from 1 to 4 and save to a list.
- Find the mean of the area from the generated.

  **Inverse CDF Method**
  `sim_circle_2()` - For this method was also also set our seed, number of trials.
  - Create a list of values "u" from a unifrom [0,1] distribution.
  - Calculate radii "r" using samples from the uniform distribution.
  - Store list of areas calculated from the radii "r" in the object "areas".
  
 ## VISUALISING SIMULATION 
We can compare the histogram and line graph of our generated areas and compare them to the actual probability density function of areas.

 **Histogram** - shows us the density i.e proportion of total each bucket of ares appears with the bucket of area 5-10 beaing the most prevalent.  
 **Line graph** - creates a probability density of our areas following the simulated sample data.
